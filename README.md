adk-serial-driver
=======
Fork from [adk-driver](https://github.com/praveendath92/adk-driver/) ( Kernel driver to set device into ADK (Accessory Development Kit) mode )

Contains same **adk** driver (with adk manifacturer string changed to "adk_serial_linux" and some log messages removed).

Adds **adk_serial** driver that creates ttyUSB files for android devices in accessory mode (currently only supports Accessory+ADB mode - breaks ADB compability)
